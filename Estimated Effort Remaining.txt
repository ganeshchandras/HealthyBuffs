Estimated Effort Remaining:
The remaining work involves the implmentation of the Spring Model View Controller. We are working on the service layer and Data Access Object (DAO) layer. We have to implement the DAO layer, where all the database connections and the communication with the database has to be established and all the querying to the database will be done on this layer. Then moving to service layer, where we will be calling different DAO layers. And the controller where all the api's will be created and will call the service layer to fech the data from the database. We will inject dependency based on the requirement of different functionality in POM.xml. And we will call all xml files that are dependent on controller. We will add those resources in web.xml. For the database connections we have to create the properties file in the resource folder of the project. And we will also keep track on no cycle creation in pom.xml. For the unit test cases we will work on api client where we will check the stability and consistency of the API's.
